      <h2>Introduction: You’re Not Behind—You’re Just Starting Here</h2>
      <p>You’re not late to the party. You’re just starting from where you are — and that’s enough. Technology isn’t a race. It’s a tool, and you get to choose how and when to use it.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1: Overcoming the Overwhelm</h2>
      <p>Technology feels overwhelming because it’s always changing. It uses unfamiliar language, updates constantly, and often assumes you already know the basics.</p>

        <li>Break problems into steps — one click at a time.</li>
        <li>Avoid comparing yourself to others. Everyone struggles at some point.</li>
      </ul>
